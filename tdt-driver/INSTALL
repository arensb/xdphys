             Installing the tdt-driver package
			 ---------------------------------

(a) make

As root:

(b) make install

You can change the install directories in the top level Makefile 
(INSTALL_LIBDIR, INSTALL_BINDIR, INSTALL_INCDIR).

Simple, huh?

Notes:

	There are some example programs in the examples directory.  Read
	the README file: it contains is important information on 
	initializing the communications link between the TDT stuff and 
	your computer.

	There are man pages for all of the utility programs: apld, xbcomini,
	xbidchck and xbsysid.
