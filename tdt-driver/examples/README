To get the TDT equipment to work, you must first do the following things:

	(1) Load ap.obj into the AP2

			apld a  <or>  apld b

		Use "apld a" if you installed your AP2 card at port 220 (the 
		default port, "Option A")

	(2) Set the communications baud rate of the XB1 bus:

		(a) Use a paperclip or something similar to press the ID button
			on each of the XB1 racks.  Keep pressing the ID button until
			the red "Activity" light stays on for that rack.
		(b) Run

				xbcomini

			The "Activity" lights for all racks should go out when you do
			this.

	(3) ID the racks:

		(a) Run

				xbsysid

			xbsysid will tell you what to do.

            ---------------------------------------------

tonetest:

	Uses:  AP2, DD1

	Simple one channel playback with the DD1.  A tone is synthesized on
	the AP2 array processor, and played from D/A output 1 of the DD1.

dualtone:

	Uses:  AP2, DD1

	Two channel playback with the DD1.  A tone is synthesized on
	the AP2 array processor, and simultaneously played from both D/A 
	outputs 1 and 2 of the DD1.

rectest:

	Uses:  AP2, DD1

	One channel recording with the DD1.  Records data from A/D input 1,
	and plots it.  This example requires a signal generator, as input
	for A/D input 1.

dualrec:

	Uses:  AP2, DD1

	Two channel recording with the DD1.  Records data from A/D inputs 1
	and 2 simultaneously, and plots the recorded data.  This example 
	requires one or two signal generators, as inputs for A/D inputs 1 and 2.

playrec:

	Uses:  AP2, DD1

	Simultaneous play/record with one D/A channel and one A/D channel.
	Records from A/D input 1, and plays from D/A output 1.  Plots
	recorded data.  This example requires either a signal generator as input 
	for A/D input 1, or that D/A output 1 be connected to A/D input 1.

dualplayrec:

	Uses:  AP2, DD1

	Simultaneous play/record with both D/A channels and both A/D channels.  
	Records from A/D inputs 1 and 2, and plays from D/A outputs 1 and 2. 
	Plots recorded data.  This example requires either a signal generator or 
	two as inputs for A/D inputs 1 and 2, or that D/A outputs 1 and 2 be 
	connected to A/D inputs 1 and 2.

tg6test:

	Uses:  AP2, DD1, TG6

	Same as dualplayrec, above, except that instead of using a software 
	trigger (i.e. DD1go(1);) to start D/A - A/D conversion, we set up
	the TG6 to send a trigger pulse to start conversion.  To get this 
	to example to work, connect TG6 output 1 to the TRIG input of the DD1.


tg6att:

	Uses:  AP2, DD1, TG6, 2 PA4's

	Same as tg6test, above, except that we have added some PA4's, to 
	attenuate the DD1 outputs.  For this example program, connect your
	setup as follows:

			DD1 D/A output 1 -> IN of PA4 #1
			DD1 D/A output 2 -> IN of PA4 #2
			OUT of PA4 #1 -> DD1 A/D input 1
			OUT of PA4 #2 -> DD1 A/D input 2
			TG6 output 1 -> TRIG input of DD1

sd1test:

	Uses:  ET1, SD1, DD1, TG6

    For a test signal for input to the SD1, use a 1 KHz, +/-5V sine wave, 
	and set the hoops for the SD1 as follows:

         Hoop #1: Slope: RISE
                  Upper: 1.0
         Hoop #2: Slope: PEAK
                  Delay: 0.13
                  Width: 0.151
                  Upper: 6.0
                  Lower: 4.0
  
    Connect your setup as follows:
  
            TG6 output 1 -> middle input of ET1
            TG6 output 2 -> DD1 "Trig" input
            Signal Generator output -> SD1 "Input" input
            Signal Generator output -> DD1 A/D input 1
            ET1 In-1 -> SD1 "First" input
            ET1 In-2 -> SD1 "Last" input

setpriority:

	A utility which can set real time scheduling priorities and policies
	for a process.  Must be run as root.

rt-demo:

	A program which demonstrates the real time scheduling capabilities 
	and memory locking capabilities of the 2.x Linux kernels.  To use it, 
	set the scheduler for the shell you're in to SCHED_FIFO, and the
	priority to 99, with setpriority (We do this so that if something
	goes wrong with rt-demo, it doesn't lock up your computer).  Then run 
	rt-demo.
