1.2.1:
	tdtproc now checks the environment variable DAQ_AP2_PORT to determine
	which port to use for apinit(); defaults to 'APa'
1.2.2:
	forgot to do the above for XB1init().  Now it does this.
1.2.3:
	made is-matlab.c delete old is_info array before inserting new one
	fixed " characters in set_att.m
1.2.4:
	fixed bug in is-matlab.c:load(): was only copying part of the input
	  waveform to the DA buffer.
	changed is_matlab.c:get_field_int() to check if the field exists
	  before trying to read it, so is_init will not segfault now when
	  you pre-initialize some fields (e.g. is_init.debugflag)
1.2.5:
	glibc > 2.0 does something screwy with stat(), so the call to stat()
	in is-tdt.c:file_is_executable() has been #ifdef'd out
1.2.6:
	in tdtproc.c, removed some extremely uneccesary calls from arm_equipment()
	which were simply chewing up time: program_da1() and check_da_buflen().

	also in tdtproc.c:arm_equipment(), fixed case in ad arming switch() 
1.2.7:
	changed att() in is-matlab: now only takes 1x2 array as its 
	argument, instead of 'left' and 'right' type settings.
1.2.8:
	documented the is_*.m files better, fixed is_record.m
	fixed an error message in is-tdt.c
1.2.9:
	iserver now uses GNU libtool to compile as a shared library on
	both SunOS and Linux.
1.2.10:
	added LED code, removed sync_pulse dependency on ET1
1.2.11:
	Moved matlab install directory to /usr/local/local-matlab

	Release 2:
	Recompiled mex files for Matlab 6
1.2.12:
	Fixed tdtproc/iserver_test.c so that it actually works.
	iserver_test is now part of the distributed package.
	Added code to tdtproc to write DA bufs to files, both before
		and after writing to the AP2 play buffers (DAQ_DA_DUMP and 
		DAQ_AP2_DA_DUMP)
